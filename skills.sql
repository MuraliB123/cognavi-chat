 POC Plan: Forecasting Cafeteria Demand at Wells Fargo (SmartQ)
üéØ Objectives
Build a system to forecast daily demand for each food counter in the cafeteria.

Predict employee presence patterns to support demand estimation.

Enhance prediction accuracy using graph-based learning and probabilistic modeling techniques.

Provide confidence scores for better operational decision-making in cafeteria management.

üîç Approach
1. Data Understanding
Employee Data:

Fields: employee ID, date, day, login time, logout time.

SmartQ Cafeteria Data:

Fields: counter name, order ID, order amount, ordered dish, employee ID.

2. Data Mapping and User Base Creation
Map each employee to the counters they frequently order from.

Create a user base list for each counter, identifying regular customers.

3. Employee Presence Forecasting
Analyze historical login/logout data to forecast the day-wise presence probability for each employee.

Identify days with maximum likelihood of employee presence.

4. Counter Demand Prediction (Time Series)
Build individual time series models for each counter based on daily historical orders.

Forecast the expected number of orders for each counter on upcoming days.

5. Employee Count Prediction (Time Series)
Build a separate time series model to predict daily active employee count based on historical attendance data.

6. Dependency Modeling (Regression)
Train a regression model to link employee attendance trends to counter demand.

Capture how changes in employee volume impact orders at different counters.

7. Confidence Score Calculation
For each counter, calculate the percentage of user base present on a given day.

Generate a confidence score for each demand prediction based on employee presence strength.

8. Graph-based Learning (GCN Enhancement)
Model the employee-counter interactions as a graph.

Apply Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to learn hidden patterns and community behaviors influencing counter demand.

9. Probabilistic Modeling Enhancement
Apply Bayesian probabilistic models (e.g., Poisson Regression) to forecast not just the expected demand but also uncertainty ranges.

Output confidence intervals for predicted demand values to support better stock and staffing decisions.

üìå Final Deliverables
Daily demand forecasts per counter with confidence intervals.

Employee presence predictions per day.

Confidence scores based on employee-counter base matching.

Model performance reports comparing traditional and advanced approaches (Time Series, Regression, GCN, Bayesian).

üß† Future Enhancements
Incorporate special event signals (e.g., festivals, public holidays) into models.

Extend to real-time predictions based on live login/order activity.

Integrate with SmartQ app for dynamic counter-wise inventory planning.
